### MyEtherWallet

MyEtherWallet is an open source, javascript, client-side tool for generating Ether wallets. It was created and is maintained by [kvhnuke](https://github.com/kvhnuke) and [tayvano](https://github.com/tayvano) aka [insomniasexx](https://www.reddit.com/user/insomniasexx).

- Official (w/ SSL): https://www.MyEtherWallet.com
- Github Direct Link: http://kvhnuke.github.io/etherwallet/





### What can it do?

- Import client wallet files and pre-sale wallet files
- Generate wallets completely client side and provide raw private keys, Keystore (Mist/geth), and paper version of the account
- Bulk generate wallets
- Generate Transactions and Broadcast Signed Transactions
- Send Tokens based on EIP20
- Give users an easy way to safely send "Only ETH" or "Only ETC" to ensure they are not victim of replay attacks
- Generate and send offline transactions, ensuring your private keys never leave your computer
- Custom ERC-721/ERC-404 support





### Our Goals

 - **Empower the people**: Everyone should be able to safely store their ETH in a wallet that they (and only they) have the keys to. Don't let exchanges lose your funds!
 - **Make it easy & free**: Everyone should be able to create a wallet and send / receive ETH & Tokens without fees and without the need to run a full node.
 - **People are the Priority**: You are the most important. Always. If monetization leads to a worse user experience, we don't do it. (ie: ads)
 - **A learning experience, too**: We want to educate about safely storing private keys and what public/private keys are. We don't want to hide behind usernames, passwords, or mnenmonics. That can come later.
 - **If it can be hacked, it will be hacked**: Never save, store, or transmit any private key anywhere at any time.
 - **Offline / Client-Side**: User should be able to run locally and offline without issue.
 - **Private**: No tracking!!! No emails. No ads. No demographics. We don't even know how many wallets have been generated or transactions have been sent, let alone who / what / where you are.
 - **Open source & audit-able**





### Users (non-developers)

I recommend you check out our help page @ https://www.myetherwallet.com/#help for any questions.

You can run MyEtherWallet.com on your computer instead of from the GitHub servers. You can generate a wallet completely offline and send transactions from the "Offline Transaction" page.

- Go to our github: https://github.com/kvhnuke/etherwallet/tree/gh-pages.
- Click download zip in the upper right.
- Move zip to an airgapped computer.
- Unzip it.
- Double-Click index.html.
- MyEtherWallet.com is now running entirely on your computer.

In case you are not familiar, you need to keep the entire folder in order to run the website, not just index.html. Don't touch or move anything around in the folder. If you are storing a backup of the MyEtherWallet repo for the future, we recommend just storing the ZIP so you can be sure the folder contents stay intact.

As we are constantly updating MyEtherWallet.com, we recommend you periodically update your saved version of the repo.





### Developers

If you want to help contribute, here's what you need to know to get it up and running and compiling.

- Both the Chrome Extension and the MyEtherWallet.com are compiling from the same codebase. This code is found in the `app` folder. Don't touch the `dist` or `chrome-extension` folders.
- We use angular and bootstrap. We used to use jQuery and Bootstrap until it was converted in April 2016. If you wonder why some things are set up funky, that's why.
- The mercury branch is currently the active development branch. We then push the dist folder live to gh-pages, which then gets served to MyEtherWallet.com.
- We use npm / gulp for compiling. There is a lot of stuff happening in the compliation.
- Our node currently runs using the json relay found in `json_relay_node`. This is written in node.js.
- Our node used to run on the json relay found in `json_relay_php` which was written in php.
- All final Chrome Extension packages are zipped and stored in `chrome-extension-releases`. We remove the favicon folder as the Chrome Store gets confused when there are 2 manifest.json files. We also remove the index.html before zipping.
- Start by running `npm install`. I currently have node v4.2.6 & npm v3.7.2 so check to see if you need to update those is something isn't working.
- You may need to install `browserify` and `angular` globally?
- Gulp will compile everything and then watch for changes to the HTML, JS, or CSS.

The app folder (where you will be working):

- `fonts` and `images` get moved into their respective folders. This isn't watched via gulp so if you add an image or font, you need to run `gulp` again.
- `includes` are the pieces of the pages / the pages themselves. These are pretty self explanatory and where you will make most frontend changes.
- `layouts` are the pages themselves. `index.html` is for MyEtherWallet.com. cx-wallet.html is the main page for the Chrome Extension. `embedded.html` is for `https://www.myetherwallet.com/embedded.html`. These basically take all the pieces of the pages and compile into one massive page. (It's not ideal and worked better when there were only 3 tabs.) The navigation is also found here...sort of.
- You can control what shows up on MyEtherWallet.com vs the Chrome Extension by using: `@@if (site === 'cx' )  {  ...  }` and `@@if (site === 'mew' ) { ... }`. Check out `sendTransaction.tpl` to see it in action. The former will only compile to the Chrome Extension. The latter only to MyEtherWallet.com.
- embedded.html is for embedding the wallet generation into third-party sites. [Read more about it and how to listen for the address generated here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4gn37o/embeddable_myetherwallet_super_simple_wallet/)
- The wallet decrypt directives are at `scripts/directives/walletDecryptDrtv.js` & `scripts/directives/cxWalletDecryptDrtv.js`. These show up on a lot of pages.
- The navigation is in `scripts/services/globalServices.js`. Again, we control which navigation items show up in which version of the site in this single file.
- As of September 2016, almost all the copy in the .tpl files are only there as placeholders. It all gets replaced via angular-translate. If you want to change some copy you need to do so in `scripts/translations/en.js` folder. You should also make a note about what you changed so that we can make sure it gets translated if necessary. You can note in the Pull Request for now. I'm not sure how we are going to maintain the different translations moving forward.
- `styles` is all the less. It's a couple custom folders and bootstrap. We try to keep the LESS/CSS and small as possible so writing a couple of custom lines of CSS instead of uncommenting an entire bootstrap file is recommended. This, in general, needs to be further cleaned up.
- Remember when I said don't touch the dist/chrome-extension folder. I lied a little bit. You need to access the Chrome Extension windows (the guys that pop down when you click the extension icon) via `chrome-extension/browser_action`. `browser_action.html` is the main one and `cx-quicksend.html` is when you click the "Quicksend" button. I would love to have these moved from the app folder too.





## How to Help Translate

**A couple of notes:**

- Everything on the entire site is broken down into lines and in this one file. It's kinda crazy. The uppermost items are the highest priority and the further you go down, the less of a priority it is.
- You can add comments anywhere by wrapping it in /* Your Comment Here */. If you want to leave a note for yourself or someone else, do so in this format. That way it doesn't screw up the code or show up somewhere on the site.
- Don't delete any lines. Just leave it in English if you don't know how to translate it.
- Always make sure each line ends with `',`. So the format is `NAME: ' your text here ',` You only need to change the `your text here` part - try not to touch anything else.

**If you are NOT a developer and have no idea how this works:**

Anyone can help out and it looks way more complicated than it is! If you would rather not deal with Github, please just email us a myetherwallet at gmail dot com and I'll email you the file and you can make changes and send it back to us and I'll make sure you don't screw anything up. If you feel like experiencing something new, read on!

1. Sign into your Github account or make a new Github account.
2. Go to https://github.com/kvhnuke/etherwallet/tree/mercury/app/scripts/translations
3. Click on the language file you want to update.
4. Look in the upper right. You will see "Raw" "Blame" and so on. Click the pencil icon. This will then tell you, *"You’re editing a file in a project you don’t have write access to. We’ve created a fork of this project for you to commit your proposed changes to. Submitting a change to this file will write it to a new branch in your fork, so you can send a pull request."* Ignore all this gibberish. [Screenshot](https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmejqvFu71QhQ5zfYMQyUYazWwnSpVHtQnE12pT2T9QEX5).
5. In your browser, start translating. Translate as little or as much as you want. [Screenshot](https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmUQd2w2ah1Bnfocuu7egamp44EqtcNCTx3TziWcmwfTme).
6. Scroll down to ~line 240 and enter your name/username, donation address, and any comments you would like to leave. [Screenshot](https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmdnhpdMZHRk1DyrFNyN7Rgm5G58NrkMJAvJNGg35oQ2UC).
7. When you are done, tell us what language you updated. You can also leave any notes about problems you had or things you'd like us to know.
8. Click the green "Propose File change" button. [Screenshot](https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmQoLPs6JkSfZsMvGCBCvudyJiWNFqcSHNMzAncjyrw1Sx)
9. This next page is a review of what you did.
10. Click the "Create Pull Request" button.....twice. [Screenshot](https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmZJJvPxXu7BFHDQ1zj1a73EATQETbsDuAJVEJnatTHrms).
11. That's it. You successfully made a new pull request! Tell all your friends.
12. We will now review it and pull it in and it will be made live on the site. We may also ask you questions if something is confusing for whatever reason.

**If you are a developer and familiar with GitHub, Pull Requests, and know how to save a JS file as a .js file rather than a Word Doc:**

1. Clone the [mercury branch](https://github.com/kvhnuke/etherwallet/tree/mercury).
2. Go to `/app/scripts/translations/`.
3. Open the language you want to translate.
4. Translate as much or as little as you wish.
5. Add your name/username, donation address, and any notes you would like on ~line 240 of the language.js file.
6. Open a PR and leave us a brief description of what you did and any issues you ran into or comments you have.
